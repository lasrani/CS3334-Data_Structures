# CS3334-Data_Structures
In my university, I took a Data Structures course. We were supposed to solve 25 questions throughout the semester involving complex data structures like trees, Disjoint Sets, graphs etc.


These questions were quite challenging for me that time and I thought they are worth sharing here!
